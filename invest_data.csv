"The upward pressure on the uranium price is about to increase significantly (2 triggers) + uranium production is hard: a lot of cuts in hoped uranium production for 2024, 2025 and beyond",the upward pressure on the uranium price is about to increase significantly  triggers  uranium production is hard a lot of cuts in hoped uranium production for   and beyond,0.0258,"Hi everyone,

**A. 2 triggers**

a) Next week the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.

With all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.

b) The last \~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.

Now there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying

The upward pressure on the uranium price is about to increase significantly

**B. Uranium mining is hard!**

UR-Energy: The production of uranium in restarting deposits is fraught with difficulties and challenges. Future production will fall short of what the market discounts as certain. Just an example, URG's production will be 43% lower than its first 1Q2024 guidance

[Source: UR-Energy](https://preview.redd.it/9wnkoz8akrqd1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93873d74259835784bbcba66933c527304fcd5c2)

Me: The available alternatives: deliverying less uranium to the clients than previously promised or buying uranium in spot

But URG is not alone!

Kazakhstan did 17% cut for their promised uranium production2025 + lower production than expected in 2026 and beyond!

Langer Heinrich too! \~2.5Mlb production in 2024, in2023 they promised 3.2Mlb for 2024

Dasa delayed by 1y (>4Mlb less for 2025), Phoenix by 2y

Peninsula Energy planned to start production end 2023, but with what UEC dis to PEN, the production of PEN was delayed by a year => Again less pounds in 2024 than initially expected. Peninsula Energy is in the process to restart ISR production end this year.

BOE EU and UUUU (good, cashflow generating, companies) also didn’t reach the amounts of uranium production for Q1, Q2 & Q3 2024 promised in previous years.

About Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium and hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond:

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/z34c1bjxkrqd1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd4f4c2ab6565bfafdd93249a10efe0932de54ae)

Here are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here):

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/hjarat42lrqd1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a39ce8815b450eec1374031b813535cc29c96041)

**Problem is that:**

a) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.

b) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?

All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.

c) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!

Conclusion:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

And the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.

And that while uranium demand is price INelastic!

And before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

**C.** Physical uranium without being exposed to mining related risks

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

The uranium LT price is at 81 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase yesterday.

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 27.00 CAD/share or 20.01 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 81 USD/lb

For instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.50 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**D.** A couple alternatives:

**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector

Here is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:

Note: I post this now (at the gradual start of high season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous 3 weeks were calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024), and the 2 weeks after the utilities started assessing all the new information they got from Kazakhstan, Russia and the WNA Symposium. Now they are analysing the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks.

Cheers","hi everyone

a  triggers

a next week the new uranium purchase budgets of us utilities will be released

with all latest announcements big production cuts from kazakhstan uranium supply warning from kazatomprom putins threat on restricting uranium supply to the west uxc confirming that inventory x is now depleted additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week  those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones

b the last  months lt contracting has been largely postponed by utilities only mlb contracted so far due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on

now there is more clarity by consequence they will now accelerate the lt contracting and uranium buying

the upward pressure on the uranium price is about to increase significantly

b uranium mining is hard

urenergy the production of uranium in restarting deposits is fraught with difficulties and challenges future production will fall short of what the market discounts as certain just an example urgs production will be  lower than its first q guidance

source urenergy

me the available alternatives deliverying less uranium to the clients than previously promised or buying uranium in spot

but urg is not alone

kazakhstan did  cut for their promised uranium production  lower production than expected in  and beyond

langer heinrich too mlb production in  in they promised mlb for 

dasa delayed by y mlb less for  phoenix by y

peninsula energy planned to start production end  but with what uec dis to pen the production of pen was delayed by a year  again less pounds in  than initially expected peninsula energy is in the process to restart isr production end this year

boe eu and uuuu good cashflow generating companies also didnt reach the amounts of uranium production for q q  q  promised in previous years

about kazatomprom announced a  cut in the hoped production for  in kazakhstan the saudiarabia of uranium and hinting for additional production cuts in  and beyond

source the financial times

here are the production figures of  not updated yet numbers of  not yet added here

source world nuclear association

problem is that

a kazakhstan is the saudiarabia of uranium kazakhstan produces around  of world uranium today so a cut of  is huge actually when comparing with the oil sector kazakhstan is more like saudi arabia russia and usa combined because saudi arabia produced  of world oil production in  russia also  and usa 

b the production of  was already fully allocated to clients meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or kazatomprom  jv partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket but from whom exactly

all the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce they are all short uranium cause many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing lt contracts that had that option integrated in the contract forcing producers to supply more uranium but those uranium producers arent able increase their production that way

c the biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is uranium one and  of uranium of uranium one comes from  well from kazakhstan

conclusion

kazatomprom cameco orano cgn  and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce because they are forced to by their clients through existing lt contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell

and the less they deliver to clients utilities the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket

there is no way around this producers andor clients someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket

and that while uranium demand is price inelastic

and before that announcement of kazakhstan the global uranium supply problem looked like this

source cameco using data from uxc  of  global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world

c physical uranium without being exposed to mining related risks

sprott physical uranium trust uun and uu on tsx is a fund  invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium only a couple places in the world here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks

sprott physical uranium trust website 

the uranium lt price is at  usdlb while uranium spotprice started to increase yesterday

a share price of sprott physical uranium trust uun at  cadshare or  usdsh represents an uranium price of  usdlb

for instance before the production cuts announced by kazakhstan and before putins threat too restrict uranium supply to the west cantor fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach  usdlb  usdlb in  and  usdlb in  knowing a couple important factors in the sector today uxc confirming that inventory x is indeed depleted now find this estimate for  modest but ok

an uranium spotprice of  usdlb in the coming months imo gives a nav for uun of  cadsh or  usdsh

and with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks i would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach  usdlb in q   q  because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector

d a couple alternatives

a couple uranium sector etfs

 sprott uranium miners etf urnm  invested in the uranium sector
 global x uranium index etf hura  invested in the uranium sector
 sprott junior uranium miners etf urnj  invested in the junior uranium sector
 global x uranium etf ura  invested in the uranium sector

here is a fragment of a report of cantor fitzgerald written before the kazak uranium supply warning before the uranium supply threat from putin and before the additional cuts in  productions from other uramium suppliers

I'm bearish on copper for 2H2024 /1H2025

a) China has been building a huge copper inventory in 1H2024, which reduces their copper buying in 2H2024/1H2025

b) The LME copper stocks are also very high compared to previous months and years: [https://www.westmetall.com/en/markdaten.php?action=table&field=LME\_Cu\_cash](https://www.westmetall.com/en/markdaten.php?action=table&field=LME_Cu_cash)

c) Temporarly lower EV increase in the world = less copper demand

The switch from ICE to EV cars increases the copper demand because there is less copper in an ICE car than in an EV car.

Reason for saying that there is a temporary slowdown in EV implementation

c.1) The demand of EV is big in China, but in Europe and USA there is a temporary slowdown (coming from Lithium specialists).

c.2) EV's are also more expensive than ICE cars. With recession incoming, that will impact consumption

d) A important recession is coming in economically important parts of the world => Copper demand decreases with such recessions

**I'm strongly bullish for copper in the Long term, because the future demand of copper is huge, while there aren't that much new big copper projects ready to become a mine in coming years**

As I’m a Microsoft employee and stock grants are part of my compensation. I’ve been trying to find a way to balance it without just selling a bunch of the stock, as I do believe it will keep going up in value. 
An advisor I talked to recently suggested to leave the current stocks as-is (as selling them will generate a large tax bill, since I have a decent amount of capital gains on them), and to just come up with a plan for future vesting.

This seems like a decent idea, but I was just curious to see what other people think or do. 
Also, given the current drop in the MSFT stock, would you still stick to that plan or just keep holding on to the stock until it goes back up?

Looking for a Better MF Portfolio Insights App,looking for a better mf portfolio insights app,0.4404,"I've been using Dezerv - wealth monitor app, for insights into my mutual fund portfolios. While it's somewhat helpful, it's limited in some aspects. For example, it will say a particular mutual fund is underperforming and then recommend mutual funds that they promote, which limits its usefulness.

Additionally, there are some features it lacks or doesn't explain well. I'm looking for an app that can provide the following features:

1. Identify overlapping mutual funds in my portfolio.

2. Offer enhancements to make my portfolio more balanced.

3. Provide suggestions based on risk exposure and diversification.

25yo just starting out financially - advice,yo just starting out financially  advice,0.0,"Hi everyone! I'm 25f from Eastern Europe, recently changed my career and only now starting to have a stable income. I have about €10k  in savings from previous jobs and will now be able to save more, perhaps around 600 to 1k per month. I have no debt of any kind.

As my financial situation is stabilizing I want to start investing more seriously. I have about half of my money in state bonds and another smaller part in term deposits, but I'm aware these kind of ""safe"" savings are not bringing much return when you take inflation into account. I want to start to invest 50 to 80% of my savings monthly into one or two ETFs. 

My time horizon is 5 to 10 years, meaning not that I want to sell all my investments in 5-10 years, but to be able to start spending the returns. The bigger picture is that I dream of having a 1-2 yr mini retirement around age 30, where I could explore what I really want to do as my current job is just a money machine. But that's far away and right now I'm more interested in the ETFs.

The strategy I'm thinking is an all-world ETF plus maybe another S&P 500 one, buy every month, don't sell anything soon, and basically forget about it until my 30s. Does this make sense?

I'm working on a unique and thrilling project that will revolutionize how we bet on cricket. Imagine being able to place bets on every single ball of a cricket match! We're developing a platform that makes this possible, and I need a bit of support to get it off the ground.

Here's the plan:

* **Real-time betting on every ball**: Our platform allows users to bet on every ball of a cricket match, bringing an entirely new level of excitement.
* **Accessible through Telegram and Discord**: We have bots ready to make betting easy and interactive on these popular platforms.
* **Web app in progress**: A user-friendly web application is currently being developed to provide a seamless betting experience.

To bring this innovative idea to life, I'm seeking an initial investment of $500-600. This will help cover final development costs and launch the platform. In return, you'll be part of an exciting venture from the ground up with potential for great returns.

If you're passionate about cricket and interested in being part of something new and exciting, I'd love to hear from you!

Thank you for considering my project.

Cannabis Possession Will be Legalized in Germany from April. Is the War on Drugs Coming to an End? Safe Supply (CSE:SPLY) Announces Closing of the Safety Strips Stake Acquisition and Could Be Set to Be at the Heart of a Potential $360Billion Industry:,cannabis possession will be legalized in germany from april is the war on drugs coming to an end safe supply csesply announces closing of the safety strips stake acquisition and could be set to be at the heart of a potential billion industry,0.7184,"[Safe Supply Streaming Co Ltd.](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/2EmYQiovYA) (CSE: SPLY) is pleased to announce that it has closed the previously announced seven (7) per cent stake acquisition of Safety Strips Tech Corp. and has paid $50,000 cash and three million (3,000,000) common shares at $0.10 CAD in Safe Supply for a total value  of $350,000 of which the common shares have a four month and one day hold period. Safe Supply is excited to report significant progress in the commercialization efforts of its new portfolio company: with the receipt of its innovative packaging solutions and engaging in late-stage discussions with two major U.S. retailers, Safety Strips is setting a rapid pace in the consumer-packaged goods  industry, focused on harm reduction.

This milestone is a testament to Safe Supply Streaming's core strategy of assembling a diversified portfolio within the Safe Supply ecosystem. Early investments like Safety Strips are carefully selected to focus on immediate revenue generation opportunities, positioning the Company for sustainable growth while awaiting further regulatory developments. Safe Supply's commitment to innovation and strategic market entry points underscores its vision to lead and expand within the evolving regulatory landscape, ensuring long-term value creation for its stakeholders.

**Bill** **Panagiotakopoulos, CEO of Safe Supply Streaming**, has been actively involved in discussions with various levels of government in Vancouver, advocating for the integration of Safety Strips in addiction centres, shelters, and other critical areas. These efforts highlight Safe Supply Streaming's leadership role in promoting harm reduction strategies across the community.

he urgency to address the fentanyl crisis is more critical than ever, particularly in a country with a population of 350 million like the US. The market for fentanyl test strips, essential in venues such as music festivals, concerts, addiction houses, and education centers, is vast and largely untapped. With too many lives lost to overdose, the need for widespread availability and use of fentanyl test strips is evident. Safety Strips is at the forefront of this battle, offering a reliable solution that meets the public's growing demand for safety measures against fentanyl poisoning. This initiative is not just a business opportunity; it's a public health imperative that Safety Strips and Safe Supply Streaming are committed to leading.

**Geoff Benic, CEO of Safety Strips**, emphasizes the company's mission, ""We are resolutely focused on commercializing our business and building a CPG brand that earns consumer trust. Our goal is to 'own the shelf' in our industry, committing to aid governments and communities in their harm reduction efforts. Our rapid progress, from early packaging arrival to promising retailer discussions in the U.S., heralds a promising future for Safety Strips and its mission.""

**Corporate Update**

The Safe Supply Board of Directors has approved the issuance of an additional 600,000 RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) to a consulting company, Machai Capital Inc., as compensation for its business development services. RSUs vest four months after the issuance and have a two-year expiry term.

The Company has also recaptured 1,250,000 stock options from a previous director of Safe Supply, Ronan Levy, who resigned on Jan 30, 2024.

If you purchase £30 of the coin (including gas fees) if the price reaches the same price as shiba 2.0 which is 11 zero's then you are looking at a £100,000+ return. This is a rare opportunity and the coin has been performing really well, slight dips here and there but it corrects itself rather quickly. If you have nothing positive to say i dont want to hear it, i am also not here for any personal gains. I am here to let you know that a £30 investment could change your life in the next few months. You could then use it to buy bitcoin or ETH and prepare for the bull run. I understand theres also a risk, but what is £30 ? Many of us spend that £30 on silly things anyway. I am extremely bullish on this coin. 

To obtain it you need coinbase wallet, invest and buy preffered amount of Ethereum, then swap it to shiba 3.0.

Why do businessmen waste diddy daddlying around with fun stuff when they meet people they want to have a business deal with instead of getting straight to the point? Why spend so much time say playing golf or exploring a museum instead of just negotiating in a private office or meeting room ASAP?,why do businessmen waste diddy daddlying around with fun stuff when they meet people they want to have a business deal with instead of getting straight to the point why spend so much time say playing golf or exploring a museum instead of just negotiating in a private office or meeting room asap,0.5423,"I was reading about how Steve McQueen wanted to do a joint movie project with Oliver Reed who was then the leading man of British cinema and highest paid actor in Europe in terms of raw paycheck. McQueen flew to London and upon meeting Reed, decided to go out with him for a drink at a bar as they discuss the business proposal for the project. As they were chatting and drinking, Reed got so intoxicated by alcohol he vomited on Steve which pissed him off so much that the idea never came through......

Reading this I can't help but wonder if the whole mess would have been avoided if Oliver and Steve just met at an office and went to the point of the deal and we'd now have a big budge film available on DVD and Blu-Ray with both Reeve and McQueen on the front cover below or above the title...... But it does make me curious.......

Oneof the reasons why businessmen have gotten a bad rap today is because so much of the general populace especially the leftist (particularly people from the Millenial generation and younger) often pictures a CEO spending thousands of dollars to fly to Paris or Tokyo or some other fancy district of a major city and then proceeding to play golf with another businessman in a field that costs over $1,000,000 per year to maintain or dine out with said businessman at a 5 star restaurant to have a meal where they drink fancy $100 wine with a bunch of plates each costing over $200 plus $150 bonus small deserts and appetizers. That so many people not involved in business think that all businessmen do is have a great time as they chitter chat with other entrepreneurs while getting a massage at a high end spa or while they're relaxing on a soft cushy sunlounger sipping tea and chatting each others with sunglasses on or their eyes closed. This is in fact one of the primary criticism against Trump, that he spends more time playing golf with other politicians and CEOs when he visits countries for economic and political negotiations than actually getting to the point to focus on real issues.

Now I know business isn't easy at all especially meetings and negotiations because business was my original major but I tossed it out fora different career path. The first time I attended a meeting at a board while in college was so draining! So I'm not a naive socialist who's eager to vote for Bernie Sanders next year.

That said I do see the point of anti-captialists and other disillussioned Americans who grown to have stereotyped business professionals as lazy and corrupt on top of being sheltered.

Why does Bill Gates need to spend a few hours playing tennis with potential business prospects instead of just having a webcam meeting with them ont he computer? Why does Jenniffer Aniston wait until a pool party to meet up with other cleebrities she's interested in as investing partners? Why can't she just drive to their own homes and discuss it possible investments at their dinner table? Is it necessary to spend a whole day drinking beer and playing billiards just to sign a contract? Why do a lot of business owners and investors feel the need to eat at a super expensive restaurant where the cheapest thing on the menu in thriple digits? Why not just save both you and your potential client money by just meeting in an office and get it over with in a 20 minute discussion? Whats the logic behind Trump spending 5 hours playing golf with another billionaire after spending 4 hours traveling in a limousine on the way to that person's house? I mean your purpose for meeting other investors and company owners is for buriness negotiations so why do you have to waste time doing fun stuff with your prospect partners and investors instead of just getting straight to the point selling your stocks within an hour? Really reading about the failed movie proposal that Steve McQueen was considering with Oliver Reed made me so curious!","i was reading about how steve mcqueen wanted to do a joint movie project with oliver reed who was then the leading man of british cinema and highest paid actor in europe in terms of raw paycheck mcqueen flew to london and upon meeting reed decided to go out with him for a drink at a bar as they discuss the business proposal for the project as they were chatting and drinking reed got so intoxicated by alcohol he vomited on steve which pissed him off so much that the idea never came through

Am I putting too little in my index fund?,am i putting too little in my index fund,0.0,"Hello:

I currently invest in the VTSAX fund at Vanguard, but I am unsure if I am contributing too little. I am a litttle nervous about putting too much into it, since the market is so volatile.

Here is my current situation:

(No credit card debt or other major debt)

I invest $500 per month in VTSAX, and there is $6K in it now. (I opened it less than a year ago)

\- I usually put away around $2.5K per month into my savings account

\- I currently have $85K in a normal savings account (at 4% interest)

\- I keep arond $7K in my checking account

Should I dump more into the VTSAX from my savings? Or is $500 per month okay? My goal is just to have a nice amount for retirement.

Thank you for any help!

The portfolio is now about 50% of value in S&P500 index funds and 50% in 10 stocks, of which 3 are tech giants. I started out doing dollar cost averaging on index funds and added the other stocks later.

The total value of portfolio is significant for me but I feel like I'm more skilled at my work in the business than making investment research and decisions. So it seems it would yield a higher return on my time to improve the business instead of learning to do proper investment analysis.

Time pressure for selling the stocks is not huge, I could probably wait 10-20 years. I may have to sell a smaller proportion meanwhile to even out unstable cashflows from the business.

My current strategy is to wait infinitely until each stock raises in value. I don't think it's a good strategy. What would you recommend to do instead? I know I don't have any qualifications to do the research at the moment so I'm a bit hesitant to just start putting in hours, I'll probably end up with a pretty bad due diligence.

Advice on Nvidia investment.,advice on nvidia investment,0.0,"Hi all. At the end of last year, and earlier this year. I made a few investments in Nvidia. By pure chance it was around the time of the rocky launch of the 40 series cards and before the AI boom. 

I am currently 149% up on my investment. 

My question is, should I sit on this and continue to invest? Or would it be better to take out the profits and reinvest, either back into Nvidia if their sticks dip or in so thing else. 

I have not invested in them recently as their stock is high and it seems I would make much on the investment, is this also the correct thing to do? 

I’m new to all this and just pretty much randomly made a lucky investment.

The Investing Renaissance: Unveiling the Synergy of Tokenization and RWA,the investing renaissance unveiling the synergy of tokenization and rwa,0.0,"Financial markets are on the precipice of a dramatic evolution, primarily driven by concepts like tokenization and Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA). Tokenization digitalizes real-world assets, creating a more resilient market while decreasing exposure to unwarranted volatility.

Parallelly, RWA provides an additional layer of financial security by mandating that banks and other financial institutions retain a certain capital amount, proportional to each asset's risk. The convergence of these innovative mechanisms heralds a new era for secure investments.

Trailblazing this path is Stobox, harnessing the accessibility and transparency of tokenization while adding the layer of financial stability ensured by RWA.

Advice on reinvesting dividends,advice on reinvesting dividends,0.0,"I've been invested in Vanguard's TIPS ETF fund (VTIP) for almost two years. The ETF has depreciated by $5 a share since then. I have been getting decent dividends, which I've reinvested. I'm wondering now whether I should start taking the cash instead now, since I see no prospect of the fund appreciating enough to get close to what I originally paid.

I'm retired, well diversified, and don't need the cash income, but I'm wondering if reinvesting is wise. I don't want to sell the fund yet, because I'd have a realized loss of almost $6,000. 

Any advice on reinvesting or taking the cash?

This hit home for me because I inherited an extensive comic book collection when my Dad passed last year. It did not occur to me just how complex of a situation it is to be given something without any knowledge of its worth, until one day I was bored and started researching his comics. Turns out his hobby is worth more than he probably thought it was… it is worth more than I could have ever imaged. Going through this, while gaining some great knowledge through my research, has changed my perspective on collecting.

Florida Theme Parks - recession indicator [Economy] [Florida] [Theme Parks],florida theme parks  recession indicator economy florida theme parks,-0.4215," 

I live in Orlando and can report the attendance at the theme parks has been atrocious the past few months. I know there is usually a lag between Spring break and Memorial day, but I haven't seen the parks consistently this dead since pre-Harry Potter (not counting 2020). And it's not just Disney, its Universal, Sea World, and Busch Gardens as well. And the parks are forecasting a bad summer you can tell with the deals that are coming out now like the Disney 4 park deal that is way discounted from the normal rate.

I think this is an indicator that the economy is finally starting to slow down and headed for a recession later this year and 2024. While I certainly don't think everything is going to fall apart like in 2008, there has been talk for years now that once the covid money dries up, interest rates go up, and inflation settles there will be a period of stagflation and then finally a recession. It will be interesting to see what happens when Disney, Universal, and Sea World report at their next earnings calls.","

Vanguard and Robinhood. Which one?,vanguard and robinhood which one,0.0,"Hi folks, I’ve been researching but yet I couldn’t figure what’s the best platform to recurring investments. I want to invest in some etfs (vti & voo), but I don’t know what’s the best platform to do so, pros and cons, etc… I’m indecisive between Vanguard and Robinhood. Clearly, Robinhood is more user friendly and much easier to automate recurring investment. But I feel that vanguard is the right place for long term investments. Which one would you pick?why? are they both similar in terms of ratio expenses/fees; do I get the same dividends % regardless the platform I invest in?
The idea is to invest daily/weekly and hold long term.
Any advice would be useful. Thank you","hi folks ive been researching but yet i couldnt figure whats the best platform to recurring investments i want to invest in some etfs vti  voo but i dont know whats the best platform to do so pros and cons etc im indecisive between vanguard and robinhood clearly robinhood is more user friendly and much easier to automate recurring investment but i feel that vanguard is the right place for long term investments which one would you pickwhy are they both similar in terms of ratio expensesfees do i get the same dividends  regardless the platform i invest in

What it will take to narrow the gap in Retirement Inequality,what it will take to narrow the gap in retirement inequality,0.0,"I reviewed a post by TIAA about Retirement Inequality.  It included many statistics about women retiring with 30% less for retirement, that there is only 9% of African Americans in the Cyber Workforce, and many other stats.  It went on to highlight people who have joined the cause.  

Problem I see is that you listed stats and people and organizations set up to help but why not say what the women and minorities can actually do to narrow that gap.  Concepts like Dollar Cost Average investing at work and at investment firms.  Than many mutual fund companies can get you started with as little as $50 a month. How about sponsoring Investment Classes at local Libraries or Schools.  What about making curicculum in school about how to manage you money better, and opportunities in the financial services industry for building retirement assets as well as career opportunities.  

Address the minority communities with career and investment opportunities; however, it MUST be emphasized that narrowing the gap takes their effort to sieze the opportunites, to invest in themselves through investment saving plans for their future.  The gap cannot be narrowed by just giving it to them.  They have to really want it and to be willing to do what it takes to get the retirement they want.  I put into a plan for that, my family and friends set the funds aside.  And if you feel that you cannot come up with even the minimum $50 a month, you just ain't trying and deserve the retirement you get.  

On a final note, TIAA set this program up; however, they blocked the ability of Reddit members from commenting.  How in Sam Hill do you expect to get a conversation going, to get word out about this if you do not permit open discussion?  Wake Up America.","i reviewed a post by tiaa about retirement inequality  it included many statistics about women retiring with  less for retirement that there is only  of african americans in the cyber workforce and many other stats  it went on to highlight people who have joined the cause

Creating Retirement Nest Egg,creating retirement nest egg,0.296,"I am 31 and considering opening a Roth IRA to generate an extra financial cushion for retirement. I am on a pension plan retirement system, so I will not be relying on this money to make it through retirement financially, but to have some extra money to buy land with/build a house when I retire without having to incur debt once on a fixed income would be ideal. My goal is to start something where I can have enough by the time I retire in 30 years or so to pay for what my spouse and I want without having to use up any of his 401(k) or our savings- just extra accrued money to get us settled into retirement debt free. We have no children and don't plan to have any, but we are going to start small with contributions and just grow those as our salaries bump up over time.

Is a Roth IRA a good option for this? If so, is Fidelity a good company to go with?
